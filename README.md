## How can you test it?
* Download the project in your computer.
* Update your PostgreSQL user and password in the **application.properties** file.
 * If you are using another SQL, you need to rewrite **application.properties**.
* Open the project in IDE, then just run it and go to localhost:8080/todos. Thats it!
